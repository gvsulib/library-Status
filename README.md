Library Status
==============

Welcome to Library Status. The system status monitoring tool.

We realized we needed an accessible place for system issues to be known and reported. The solution was to create Library Status so all system issues could be reported and acknowledge with one simple status monitoring tool.

## Installing
1. Create database from /status.sql
2. Add custom systems to database.
3. Alter /resource/secret/config-sample.php with your database credentials 
4. Connect your log in system of choice /admin.php
5. Profit
