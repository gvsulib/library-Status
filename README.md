Library Status
==============

Welcome to Library Status. The system status monitoring tool.

We realized we needed an accessible place for system issues to be known and reported. The solution was to create Library Status so all system issues could be reported and acknowledge with one simple status monitoring tool.

## Installing
1. Install status.sql
2. To connect to your new status.sql database alter /resource/secret/config-sample.php
3. Add your custom systems to database.
4. Connect your log in system of choice /admin.php
